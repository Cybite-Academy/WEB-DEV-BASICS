`//? === Datatypes
    there are 8 datatypes in JS but we will be teaching 6:
    string
    number
    undefined
    null
    boolean
    object



    //? --- String
    they are for storing text and they are written in quotes (single or double)
    e.g:
`;
    console.log("my name is john");
    
    //String with variable
    let name = 'peter';
    let password = '123$445ajh';
    console.log(name);
    console.log(password);



    `//? --- Number
    there are integers and float values (basically whole numbers and decimals);
    e.g:
    `
    console.log(400);

    //Number with variable
    let age = 100;
    let length = 28.67;

    //exponential Notation
    let x = 124e5;
    let z = 125e-5;
    console.log(x, z);



    `//? --- Boolean
    they are true and false
    `
    let isBoy = true;
    let isJobDone = false;

    let a = 5;
    let b = 5;
    let c = 6;
    console.log(a == b); //true
    console.log(a == c); // false

    console.log( 10 == 300 ); //false
    console.log(10 == 10); //true

    console.log(b == 500);//false
